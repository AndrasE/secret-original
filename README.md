## Hi there 👋

While I was doing my self-studies on Udemy I felt intrigued to take a project further as by using EJS with MongoDb user could interact with the App. This was the first finished app for the idea. As I wanted to add extra bits, I later recreated the repo and redisinged it. Simple application, but a useful base! 

I hope you find it useful for your own project!

Thank you, code safe! 💻

ps.: If you want to see the deployment it`s hosted on heroku eco-tier the server,it might take 2-3s to spin up, please be patient. 🐨
