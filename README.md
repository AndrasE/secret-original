## Hi there 👋

While I was doing my self-studies on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a> I felt intrigued to take a project further as by using EJS with MongoDb user could interact with the App. 
This was the first finished product. As I wanted to add extra bits, I later recreated the repo on the name secrets and redesigned it. This one is maybe a s
imple application, but also a very useful base! 

I hope you can find it useful too!

Thank you, code safe! 💻

ps.: If you want to see the deployment its hosted on heroku eco-tier the server, it might take 2-3s to spin up, please be patient. 🐨
