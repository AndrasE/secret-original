EJS webapp with MongoDb database & OAuth options with Express (session) cookies
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During my self-studies on **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)**, we developed a project that integrates **[EJS](https://ejs.co/)** with **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**, allowing users to interact with the app.

Later, I revamped the project under the name 
**[Secrets](https://github.com/AndrasE/secrets)** and gave it a fresh new interface, authentication and swipe functionality. While it may seem like a simple application, it holds special significance for me as it marked my first real step into full-stack development. The project demonstrates how to build a basic EJS/MongoDB/Express/Node app, and I hope you find it as useful as I did!

The app is deployed on Heroku's eco-tier, so please allow 2-3 seconds for it to load - thank you for your patience!

## Run ðŸš€

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

`

Or if you prefer using Yarn:
